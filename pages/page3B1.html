    <h1>You decide to walk to your parents house.</h1>
    <h2>
      About halfway there, you notice you are being followed by a shady-looking person. Figuring milk isn't worth your life, you decide to make a run for it. In your rush to get away, you run into a sign post and knock yourself out. Thankfully, the person who was following you was just trying to return the wallet you dropped; they even helped you back to your house. But no milk.
