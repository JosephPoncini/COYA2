    <h1>You decide to uber to your parents.</h1>
    <h2>The ride seemed nice at first. Then the driver turns to you and asks if "you've ever danced with the devil under the pale moon light". Thats when you notice that the driver is in fact the joker from the 1989 Batman film. You pray this is a dream; it clearly is. You throw yourself awake and notice that you're a little thirsty. Man, it would be cool if you had some milk.</h2>
