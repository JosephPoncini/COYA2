// Peer Review Comments: Looks good, Story is well written (loved the joker part). All images are AI generated and funny looking which is a great addition(jokers face is pretty funny looking i love it). In the future i would recommend making the page links into buttons (like it was on the title page).  A background page would look nice too but isn't necessary. Other than that job well done.
